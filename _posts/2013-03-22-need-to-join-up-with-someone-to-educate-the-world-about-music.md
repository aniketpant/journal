### 2013-03-22 19:39, Need to join up with someone to educate the world about music. 

I happened to listen to UK Top 40 today and it was full of pop BS. I don't know what the world is coming to. I understand that everyone cannot appreciate metal but there is so much people can appreciate, like 'The Almost', 'Sum 
41', 'Three Days Grace' and 'Goo Goo Dolls'. All they listen to is pop-ism music which sounds the same everywhere, makes no sense and has absolutely zero treasure-keeping value.
