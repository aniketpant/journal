### 2013-04-10 19:53, Need to sync. 

Have to start writing the code for syncing jrnl to my git repo. It's not much effort because export to files is done, even the other exports are complete. But it still needs to be sorted out that the sync will also have features similar to the export. I am definitely going for sync with separate files converted to markdown, so that it can be used for a Jekyll site.
