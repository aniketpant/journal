### 2013-03-21 06:51, Pathetic day. 

Exams are starting up and will keep me busy for the next 5 days. There isn't  much I can do in the meantime because my head is full of this stuff I need to study. Apart from the above, I need to find someone to wind up the project I took by chance and also start work on the other one. Life is about to get hectic.
