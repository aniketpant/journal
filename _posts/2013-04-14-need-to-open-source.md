I feel that there is a need for an open source project that will generate some activity in the current application development community. As of now, a large number of developers are following into the footsteps of the rest and creating new applications. But at any point of time, the methodology never comes out in the open. What we need is a handbook. We need people to participate and create guidelines for writing applications. Yes, that is what we need. The freedom developers get at the point of time is absolutely brilliant but if these applications were made after the process followed by some experienced developers, the projects will definitely have the scope of extension.
