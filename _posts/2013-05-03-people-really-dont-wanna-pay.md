title: People really don't wanna pay.

Just came across a small conversation between two guys in my college and it seems like decision for most purchases depends on what free apps you can get later. A guy was asking if Nokia Lumia 720 is a good buy or not? And the person who replied says that it doesn't have any free apps and minimum price of any game is 250 bucks. I am very much shocked that free apps actually make the impact on a purchase. People **do not** wish to pay a single penny for a software a company/developer invested their time into. It's amazes me.
