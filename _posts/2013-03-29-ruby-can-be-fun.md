### 2013-03-29 22:48, Ruby can be fun. 

Ruby is getting fun for me as I can write my own CLI apps and working on apps in part-time is really fun. There's so much scope to fiddle with and you can just keep working on features. I am still confused about the potential of these languages and I doubt that they ever will jump the shark for me.
