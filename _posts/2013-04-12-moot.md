### 2013-04-12 21:12, Moot. 

Just joined http://moot.it/ Seems like a great service for creating forums. The only issue I feel that all these services pose is the disconnect from using email as an effective framework. I cannot participate in discussions via just email, unlike Basecamp. If something just integrates with email, then I will be a customer for life.
