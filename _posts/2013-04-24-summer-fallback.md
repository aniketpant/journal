Just installed heroku on my system. I had my account ready for ages but then I forgot to install the toolbelt. Finally it is installed. I really like the tutorial they have provided on the dashboard, it's a really good implementation of a good learning process. It makes you deploy your first heroku app which uses sinatra and outputs "Hello World". I think I can take i-r-poet to heroku soon, and convert the entire implementation to Sinatra or let it be Rails for now. Or, I can also use that other cool Ruby framework called Cuba. I think I will try Cuba as it's really cool and takes much more requests compared to Rails and it is a closer alternative to sinatra.
