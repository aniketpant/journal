### 2013-04-16 22:12, Play your old stuff. 

Whatever music might keep coming into the industry, I doubt that I can even stop listening to the old stuff I have. Be it Underoath, Bury Tomorrow, August Burns Red, Texas in July, The Word Alive - all of them keeping appearing in my playlist every now and then.
