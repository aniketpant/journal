### 2013-03-27 21:46, Do I need multiple journals? 

I feel I can have 2-3 journals, one will be default which will have anything that I write (something like what I am doing at the moment), the other one can be for my work related stuff that can be the encrypted type and the last one for poetry. It does sound good.
