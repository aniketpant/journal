2013-04-10 15:58 First contact with WordPress.
Today I got the opportunity to talk to one of the mentors at WordPress for GSoC 2013. The guy is well versed with import/export operations and he is really into it. All he cares about is making these utilities better and I feel that I can also work in the same domain considering the fact that I wrote a restore operation for Codeigniter in the past. The new idea for WordPress is great because it will definitely be a big improvement over the already existing system as it will leaner and will be usable in other places.
