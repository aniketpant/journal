I am still not sure why I avoided learning Java all this long. It might have been because of the fact that it used a very different set of tools or it was all in my head. I started learning the language a day back from a course by Princeton. Since I already know PHP, Ruby, JavaScript and tiny bits of Haskell, covering up the basics of Java is no big deal. In the last few weeks, I have also been advised to learn about Spring framework and I started with it today.
