Had a great discussion with @jayrambhia about the need of open source projects and why India is lagging behind. We rarely come across an Indian starting off a new project which actually draws a crowd. I find it hard to believe that people are not taking the initiative to start projects of this sort. And I think that I know the reason why these projects never start, most Indian developers never even bother to shift from freelancing to personal projects. I am not sure why this trend is prevalent but it has been happening for long and I have a feeling that it will continue to happen. There is so much a developer can do for the world. The person can create a simple tool that might solve the problems for a thousand people. Why would he not take the first step to start something. Won't it make them happy to create a project that a million developers will thank him/her for the rest of their lives. I am surely going to work on something that will solve a problem of mine and also of many others. And I am sure it will be one hell of a ride.
