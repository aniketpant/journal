### 2013-04-29 10:48, New project names. 

I am going to start work on some new projects in the summer and I shall call them "Musket" and "Bandook". I think it's time that I get on with the habit of giving cool names to my projects and give them a personality of their own. "Musket" would be a simple Gem that will generate templates for my projects. "Bandook" will be a Gem for watching my directory for changes and syncing them to another directory.
