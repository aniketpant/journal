I am going to start work on some new projects in the summer and I shall call them _Musket_, _Bandook_ and _Sheesha_. I think it's time that I get on with the habit of giving cool names to my projects and give them a personality of their own. **Musket** would be a simple Gem that will generate templates for my projects. **Sheesha** will be a Gem for watching my directory for changes and syncing them to another directory. And I am yet to decide what **Bandook** would do.
