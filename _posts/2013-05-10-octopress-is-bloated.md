### 2013-05-10 18:02, Octopress is bloated. 

I am in the process of porting TLOF from Octopress to a standard Jekyll version. Octopress was way too big for a small blog. My journal was already ready, so all I had to do was use the same files for TLOF. Only the styling is left for the new version. Should be done in a day. Will start writing on it again.
