2013-04-03 17:02 Why don't companies release simple features first?
For sometime I have been wondering why companies don't release the very basic features in their applications in the first place. The very first example in this case would be Facebook. Facebook came out with message forwarding in 2012 and I am not sure how difficult would it have been for them to make a simple thing like this. Similarly, Twitter gave us the ability to download our archive a couple of weeks ago and this could have been their very first feature. It is very simple to create and all it takes would be a a couple of SQL queries and the work would be done. The one thing that keeps me thinking is, is there some kind of business motive behind the actions or did they never include these features in their plan of action?
