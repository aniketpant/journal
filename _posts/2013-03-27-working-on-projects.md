### 2013-03-27 22:21, Working on projects. 

I need to find a method for managing time among the projects I am handling nowadays. Prioritization is a must! Will spend tomorrow working on the one I can finish the earliest and then carry the work forward in the coming days. Basic plan of work: Finish major work by this weekend.
