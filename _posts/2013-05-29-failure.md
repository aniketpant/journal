It ain't bad. You always learn a lot from your failures and I surely have learnt something from mine. No matter what happens, you can always work on your own. Start a project of your own and find a way out. Interact with others and look for a method to do things differently. In the last 10 days, I have worked on three projects including the revamp of one old project. It's abosolutely amazing with what I can do with softwares every single day.
